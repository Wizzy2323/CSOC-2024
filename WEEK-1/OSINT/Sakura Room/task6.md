## HOMEBOUND
### Description-
- Background

Based on their tweets, it appears our cybercriminal is indeed heading home as they claimed. Their Twitter account seems to have plenty of photos which should allow us to piece together their route back home. If we follow the trail of breadcrumbs they left behind, we should be able to track their movements from one location to the next back all the way to their final destination. Once we can identify their final stops, we can identify which law enforcement organization we should forward our findings to.

In OSINT, there is oftentimes no "smoking gun" that points to a clear and definitive answer. Instead, an OSINT analyst must learn to synthesize multiple pieces of intelligence in order to make a conclusion of what is likely, unlikely, or possible. By leveraging all available data, an analyst can make more informed decisions and perhaps even minimize the size of data gaps. In order to answer the following questions, use the information collected from the attacker's Twitter account, as well as information obtained from previous parts of the investigation to track the attacker back to the place they call home.

#### The first question was-
```
What airport is closest to the location the attacker shared a photo from prior to getting on their flight?
```
On the attackers twitter account I got these photos

By reverse searching the above image I got to see the Washington monument and got a glimpse of Spiderman movie in my head.Hence the I googled airports in washington dc and hence I got the answer-
```
DCA
```
#### The second question was
```
What airport did the attacker have their last layover in?
```
The second image had something to do with this. So I googled JAL first class Sakura Launge and got this [link](https://singleflyer.com/2018/04/08/japan-airlines-first-class-lounge-tokyo-hnd/) which had the answer
```
HND
```
#### The third question was
```
What lake can be seen in the map shared by the attacker as they were on their final flight home?
```
Now this question had something to do with this image-

One can clearly see the dark blue dot over the map of Japan that the lake-
```
Lake Inawashiro
```
#### The fourth question was
```
What city does the attacker likely consider "home"?
```
Which solving the BSSID question I pointer pointed to the city-
```
Hirosaki
```
