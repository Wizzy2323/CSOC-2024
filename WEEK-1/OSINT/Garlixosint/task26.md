## Task briefing:
The image below shows the contents of a zip file. Inside you will find a 31-second video recorded during a train ride, and four photos of undisclosed locations. They were all taken by the same individual in February 2024. Despite having no useful metadata, they still contain enough information to track down this personâ€™s movements.
Your task is to determine:

a) At which train stations did the person board and alight?
## Bonus challenges:

- Identify the mode of transportation in each image.
- Determine the type of train they rode.
- Estimate the speed at which the train was travelling when the footage was recorded.
- Calculate approximately how far did the person travel overall.
Firstly I reversearched  this image -

And got to know that it is Navruz Park Uzbekistan. 

Now it is clear that that the person was Travelling Uzbekistan and it is quite possible that the images where taken in this order(refering the sequence number of the image)-

Reverse searching the first image I got to know that it is Chorsu Bazar ,Tashkent Uzbekistan. The second image is from Navruz Park Uzbekistan. I got the following search results from duplichecker.com

Now reverse searching the third image took a lot of time firstly I searched about samsung galaxy buildings and then about Navien Building but after a long struggle I got to know that it was not a Navien building but just an advertising find all of this took a lot of time because I had to go through every search result on google earth and go through its street view. But the most important thing was Kapital bank atm on google earth and then going through the street view of of some of the result I found this-

This place is in Tashkent Uzbekistan Mirabad Street.

Now reverse searching the fourth image on duplichecker.com I got this link on [yandex](https://daryo.uz/2022/02/12/yiliga-25-mln-yolovchiga-xizmat-qiladigan-aeroport-oliy-oquv-yurtlariga-imtihonsiz-qabul-qilinadigan-4-nafar-oquvchi-10-nafar-rahbar-ishdan-olingan-yigilish%2F). Searching for the image in the article I got this-

I used google translate to convert the above text into english and I got this-

So now we are in Samarkand. Now it is possible that the traveller travelled from Uzbekistan to Samarkand. After searching a lot for flyovers parking in Samarkand I finally got here-
